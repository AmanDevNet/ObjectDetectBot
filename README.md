# DetectBot - Object Detection for Robotics

## Description

RoboVision is an AI-powered object detection system designed for robotic applications. It uses deep learning models to detect and classify objects in real-time, making it ideal for autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and robotic vision tasks.

## Tech Stack:

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- JAX
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Requirements:

Install the following dependencies before running the project:

```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras jax numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RoboVision.git
   cd RoboVision
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the object detection script:
   ```bash
   python detect.py
   ```

## Features:

- Real-time object detection
- Supports multiple deep learning models
- Can be integrated with robotic systems
- Optimized for speed and accuracy

## Usage:

1. Provide an input image or video stream.
2. The model detects and classifies objects in real-time.
3. Results are displayed with bounding boxes and labels.

## Future Enhancements:
